					<h2>Liability Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						This basic motorcycle insurance pays out when your bike causes damage to someone or something else. If you drive an older motorcycle and don’t have many other assets to protect, you may not need much more coverage than this. Check with your local agent to find out.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Collision Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						This picks up where liability insurance leaves off&mdash;it covers your own motorcycle when you cause an accident or hit a stationary object. This coverage is especially important if you ride a newer model or carry a loan.
