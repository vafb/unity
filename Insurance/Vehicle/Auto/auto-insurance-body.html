					<h2>Liability Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						This basic auto insurance pays out when your car, truck, or van causes damage to someone or something else. If you drive an older car and don’t have many other assets to protect, you may not need much more coverage than this. Check with your local agent to find out.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Collision Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						This picks up where liability insurance leaves off&mdash;it covers your own vehicle when you cause an accident or hit a stationary object. This coverage is especially important if you drive a newer model car or carry an auto loan.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Other Than Collision Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						Sometimes called comprehensive coverage, this option covers damage to your car not caused by a collision. It takes care of issues like fire, theft, vandalism, glass breakage, weather-related damage, and deer that come out of nowhere.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5">
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Medical Expense Benefit</h2>
					<p>
						This can offset your health insurance deductible and pay out for your passengers’ injuries if necessary. It’s also an added buffer if you’re liable in an accident that causes serious injuries.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-5 col-md-pull-5">
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Pet Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						Extend your insurance protection to your furry friends as well. If your dog or cat is with you during an accident and is injured or worse, this coverage goes toward vet bills or pays a death benefit (similar to life insurance). It’s built in to comprehensive coverage.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Transportation Expenses</h2>
					<p>
						If your vehicle suffers damage that’s covered under your policy, your transportation expenses (such as rental car charges) can be covered up to a specified amount while your car is being repaired or replaced.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">

					<h2>Electronic Equipment Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						If you’ve upgraded your stereo, this option is for you. This protection applies to custom parts or equipment, devices, accessories, enhancements, and changes other than those installed by the original manufacturer that alter the performance of your vehicle.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5">
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Income Loss Benefits</h2>
					<p>
						Car accidents can cause serious, life-altering injuries that may force you to miss time at work. This coverage can help provide for your family if accident-related injuries keep you off the job and cause a loss of income.

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="margin-sm">
					<h2>Customized Equipment Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						Non-electronic modifications to your truck or van require this special coverage. You can insure the value of your custom seats, special furnishings, carpeting, wheelchair lift or other interior customizations with this option.

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5">
				<div class="margin-sm">

						Talking with your local agent is the best way to find out what riders or specific coverages are recommended for your specific situation. You may need to fill a gap with one of these:

						<li>Death Indemnity Coverage</li>
						<li>Tapes, Records, Disks, and Other Media Coverage</li>
