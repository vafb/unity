							<h1>Budget Shortfall on Key Ag & Forestry Programs</h1>

However, additional cuts could have a drastic impact on the economic impact of the largest industry in Commonwealth. Based on the information available at the end of October, we request legislators consider the impact by:</h3>

							<p>Supporting maintaining and identifying the shortfall of funding needed in the agriculture best management practices cost-share program to meet water quality goals as well as the operational and technical assistance to get those conservation practices implemented by local Soil and Water Conservation Districts</p>

							<p>Supporting restoring and opposing further cuts to the wildlife damage cooperative program for matching funds from Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) for implementation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services for landowner assistance programs for coyotes and black vultures.</p>

							<p>Supporting maintaining the funding provided for equipment replacement and upgrades and personnel for emergency preparedness for fighting fires by the Department of Forestry</p>

							<p>Support funding for equipment and facilities replacement and upgrades for twelve regional Virginia Tech’s Agricultural Research and Extension Centers (off campus) to help address emerging plant and animal diseases and speed up specific commodity product development as a strategic investment in continuing to expand Virginia farms’ economic growth</p>

							<h1>Maintain the Water Rights of Landowners</h1>
							<h3 class="lead">Virginia Farm Bureau urges legislators to allow studies to continue to investigate the immediate and long- term impact of programs that may alter the ownership of water.</h3>

							<p>Recent science is indicating that the primary aquifer that provides groundwater to eastern Virginia is rapidly approaching a critically low level. This is due to extensive withdrawals by two industrial users (paper production facilities), one local government, a couple of poultry and livestock processing plants, along with many unknown small users. These withdrawals are causing other wells to dry up including those artesian free-flowing wells once prevalent in eastern Virginia. They are also believed to be responsible for land subsidence and sea-level rise because the aquifer and the land are drying up or shrinking; this is thought to be more of a problem than sea level rise due to climate change.</p>
