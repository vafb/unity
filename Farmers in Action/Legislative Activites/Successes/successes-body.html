				<p>An 85% or better success rate on the number of policy issues achieved is possible with the Farm Bureau team approach. Our positions are well thought out and debated as the issue works it way from the local level to the state level. When Farm Bureau takes a position, it is supported by farmers from across the Commonwealth. It is not a small group of people making these decisions on our policy positions but a democratic process involving engaging members. Farm Bureau has a professional staff keeping farmers informed on the issues they may be confronting, representing their positions on a daily basis before legislative, government agencies or to other groups and garnering the support needed to implement the issue position.</p>

				<p>Farm Bureau represents all types of farmers producing every type of commodity operating all different sizes of farms and agri-businesses. We have included some overall successes as well as issue position successes by commodity category.</p>
