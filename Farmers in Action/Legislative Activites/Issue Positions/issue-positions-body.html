				<p>Virginia Farm Bureau Federation is the state’s largest farm organization, with 35,870 producer member families. Farm Bureau is a voluntary, non-governmental organization wholly owned and controlled by its members and financed by membership dues.</p>

				<p>The following state-level policies are the result of thorough consideration and recommendations from our producer members. These policies began at the county level, introduced perhaps by a single individual, and have evolved through the policy development channels. These policies most accurately reflect the consensus of our policymakers from all corners of Virginia and most widely affect the state’s farming community.</p>
				
				<p>These state policies do not include VFBF’s position on federal issues. VFBF’s elected policymakers participate in the American Farm Bureau Federation policy process, and VFBF utilizes AFBF policies for positions on federal issues. The VFBF president, staff and/or board of directors are responsible for the interpretation of these policies. Please contact the Governmental Relations Department with any question regarding implementation or interpretation of these policies.</p>
