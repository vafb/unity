			<h1>Take Action</h1>
			<p>
				Throughout the year, Farm Bureau staff send out Action Alerts asking our producer members to voice their concerns about specific agricultural issues to their legislators. The more our members respond to these Action Alerts, the more effective we are in making sure Virginia farmers are protected.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2010, Farm Bureau members responded to Action Alerts regarding federal legislation that would unfairly blame farmers and overestimate their impact on the Chesapeake Bay. Their efforts resulted in 28,000 contacts made to U.S. Sens. Warner and Web and Virginia’s delegation in the House of Representatives, including personal visits, emails, phone calls and more than 18,000 letters.&nbsp;These contacts played a huge role in the defeat of the legislation.
